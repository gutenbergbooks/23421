    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we collaborate?&rdquo; said Henley in his most matter-of-fact
      way, as Big Ben gave voice to the midnight hour. &ldquo;Everybody does it
      nowadays. Two heads may be really better than one, although I seldom
      believe in the truth of accepted sayings. Your head is a deuced good one,
      Andrew; but&mdash;now don&rsquo;t get angry&mdash;you are too excitable and too
      intense to be left quite to yourself, even in book-writing, much less in
      the ordinary affairs of life. I think you were born to collaborate, and to
      collaborate with me. You can give me everything I lack, and I can give you
      a little of the sense of humour, and act as a drag upon the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of the new humour, Jack; that shall never appear in a book with my
      name attached to it. Dickens I can tolerate. He is occasionally
      felicitous. The story of &lsquo;The Dying Clown,&rsquo; for instance, crude as it is
      it has a certain grim tragedy about it. But the new humour came from the
      pit, and should go&mdash;to the <i>Sporting Times</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get excited. The book is not in proof yet&mdash;perhaps never
      will be. You need not be afraid. My humour will probably be old enough.
      But what do you y to the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Trenchard sat for awhile in silent consideration. His legs were
      stretched out, and his slippered feet rested on the edge of the brass
      fender. A nimbus of smoke surrounded his swarthy features, his shock of
      black hair, his large, rather morose, dark eyes. He was a man of about
      twenty-five, with an almost horribly intelligent face, so observant that
      he tried people, so acute that he frightened them. His intellect was never
      for a moment at rest, unless in sleep. He devoured himself with his own
      emotions, and others with his analysis of theirs. His mind was always
      crouching to spring, except when it was springing. He lived an irregular
      life, and all horrors had a subtle fascination for him. As Henley had
      remarked, he possessed little sense of humour, but immense sense of evil
      and tragedy and sorrow. He seldom found time to calmly regard the drama of
      life from the front. He was always at the stage-door, sending in his card,
      and requesting admittance behind the scenes. What was on the surface only
      interested him in so far as it indicated what was beneath, and in all
      mental matters his normal procedure was that of the disguised detective.
      Stupid people disliked him. Clever people distrusted him while they
      admired him. The mediocre suggested that he was liable to go off his head,
      and the profound predicted for him fame, tempered by suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people considered him interesting, and a few were sincerely attached
      to him. Among these last was Henley, who had been his friend at Oxford,
      and had taken rooms in the same house with him in Smith&rsquo;s Square,
      Westminster. Both the young men were journalists. Henley, who, as he had
      acknowledged, possessed a keen sense of humour, and was not so much
      ashamed of it as he ought to have been, wrote&mdash;very occasionally&mdash;for
      <i>Punch</i>, and more often for <i>Fun</i>, was dramatic critic of a
      lively society paper, and &ldquo;did&rdquo; the books&mdash;in a sarcastic vein&mdash;for
      a very unmuzzled &ldquo;weekly,&rdquo; that was libellous by profession and truthful
      by oversight. Trenchard, on the other hand, wrote a good deal of very
      condensed fiction, and generally placed it; contributed brilliant fugitive
      articles to various papers and magazines, and was generally spoken of by
      the inner circle of the craft as &ldquo;a rising man,&rdquo; and a man to be afraid
      of. Henley was full of common-sense, only moderately introspective,
      facile, and vivacious. He might be trusted to tincture a book with the
      popular element, and yet not to spoil it; for his literary sense was keen,
      despite his jocular leaning toward the new humour. He lacked imagination;
      but his descriptive powers were racy, and he knew instinctively what was
      likely to take, and what would be caviare to the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trenchard, as he considered the proposition now made to him, realized that
      Henley might supply much that he lacked in any book that was written with
      a view to popular success. There could be no doubt of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we should quarrel inevitably and doggedly,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;If I
      can not hold myself in, still less can I be held in. We should tear one
      another in pieces. When I write, I feel that what I write must be, however
      crude, however improper or horrible it may seem. You would want to hold me
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, I should more than want to&mdash;I should do it. In
      collaboration, no man can be a law unto himself. That must be distinctly
      understood before we begin. I don&rsquo;t wish to force the proposition on you.
      Only we are both ambitious devils. We are both poor. We are both
      determined to try a book. Have we more chance of succeeding if we try one
      together? I believe so. You have the imagination, the grip, the stern
      power to evolve the story, to make it seem inevitable, to force it step by
      step on its way. I can lighten that way. I can plant a few flowers&mdash;they
      shall not be peonies, I promise you&mdash;on the roadside. And I can, and,
      what is more, will, check you when you wish to make the story impossibly
      horrible or fantastic to the verge of the insane. Now, you needn&rsquo;t be
      angry. This book, if we write it, has got to be a good book, and yet a
      book that will bring grist to the mill. That is understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew&rsquo;s great eyes flashed in the lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes I feel inclined to let it stop working.
      Who would care if one wheel ceased to turn? There are so many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the sort of thing I shall cut out of the book!&rdquo; cried Henley,
      turning the soda-water into his whisky with a cheerful swish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will be powerful, but never morbid; tragic, if you like, but not
      without hope. We need not aspire too much; but we will not look at the
      stones in the road all the time. And the dunghills, in which those weird
      fowl, the pessimistic realists, love to rake, we will sedulously avoid.
      Cheer up, old fellow, and be thankful that you possess a corrective in
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trenchard&rsquo;s face lightened in a rare smile as, with a half-sigh, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right, and that I need a collaborator, an opposite, who
      is yet in sympathy with me. Yes; either of us might fail alone; together
      we should succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will</i> succeed, my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not by pandering to the popular taste,&rdquo; added Andrew in his most
      sombre tones, and with a curl of his thin, delicately-moulded lips. &ldquo;I
      shall never consent to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not call it pandering. But we must hit the taste of the day, or
      we shall look a couple of fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are always supposed to look fools when, for once, they are not
      fools,&rdquo; said Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. But now our bargain is made. Strike hands upon it. Henceforth
      we are collaborators as well as friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew extended his long, thin, feverish hand, and, as Henley held it for
      a moment, he started at the intense, vivid, abnormal personality its grasp
      seemed to reveal. To collaborate with Trenchard was to collaborate with a
      human volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the germ of our book,&rdquo; he said, as the clock struck one.
      &ldquo;Where shall we find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trenchard leaned forward in his chair, with his hands pressed upon the
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, and I will give it you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, almost until the dawn and the wakening of the slumbering city, Henley
      sat and listened, and forgot that his pipe was smoked out, and that his
      feet were cold. Trenchard had strange powers, and could enthral as he
      could also repel.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a weird idea, and it is very powerful,&rdquo; Henley said at last. &ldquo;But
      you stop short at the critical moment. Have you not devised a <i>dénouement?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. That is where the collaboration will come in. You must help me.
      We must talk it over. I am in doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and passed his hands nervously through his thick hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My doubt has kept me awake so many nights!&rdquo; he said, and his voice was
      rather husky and worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henley looked at him almost compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How intensely you live in your fancies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fancies?&rdquo; said Andrew, with a sudden harsh accent, and darting a
      glance of curious watchfulness upon his friend. &ldquo;My&mdash;&mdash; Yes,
      yes. Perhaps I do. Perhaps I try to. Some people have souls that must
      escape from their environment, their miserable life-envelope, or faint.
      Many of us labour and produce merely to create an atmosphere in which we
      ourselves may breathe for awhile and be happy. Damn this London, and this
      lodging, and this buying bread with words! I must create for myself an
      atmosphere. I must be always getting away from what is, even if I go
      lower, lower. Ah! Well&mdash;but the <i>dénouement</i>. Give me your
      impressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henley meditated for awhile. Then he said; &ldquo;Let us leave it. Let us get to
      work; and in time, as the story progresses, it will seem inevitable. We
      shall see it in front of us, and we shall not be able to avoid it. Let us
      get to work&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at his watch and laughed&mdash;&ldquo;or, rather,
      let us get to bed. It is past four. This way madness lies. When we
      collaborate, we will write in the morning. Our book shall be a book of the
      dawn, and not of the darkness, despite its sombre theme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it must be a book of the darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the darkness, then, but written in the dawn. Your tragedy tempered by
      my trust in human nature, and the power that causes things to right
      themselves. Good-night, old boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Henley had left the room, Tren-chard sat for a moment with his head
      sunk low on his breast and his eyes half closed. Then, with a jerk, he
      gained his feet, went to the door, opened it, and looked forth on the
      deserted landing. He listened, and heard Henley moving to and fro in his
      bedroom. Then he shut the door, took off his smoking-coat, and bared his
      left arm. There was a tiny blue mark on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will the <i>dénouement</i> be?&rdquo; he whispered to himself, as he felt
      in his waistcoat pocket with a trembling hand.

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The book was moving onward by slow degrees and with a great deal of
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days Henley and Trenchard lived much with sported oaks. They were
      battling for fame. They were doing all they knew. Literary gatherings
      missed them. First nights knew them no more. The grim intensity that was
      always characteristic of Trenchard seemed in some degree communicated to
      Henley. He began to more fully understand what the creating for one&rsquo;s self
      of an atmosphere meant. The story he and his friend were fashioning
      fastened upon him like some strange, determined shadow from the realms of
      real life, gripped him more and more closely, held him for long spells of
      time in a new and desolate world. For the book so far was a deepening
      tragedy, and although, at times, Henley strove to resist the paramount
      influence which the genius of Trenchard began to exercise over him, he
      found himself comparatively impotent, unable to shed gleams of popular
      light upon the darkness of the pages. The power of the tale was undoubted.
      Henley felt that it was a big thing that they two were doing; but would it
      be a popular thing&mdash;a money-making thing? That was the question. He
      sometimes wished with all his heart they had chosen a different subject to
      work their combined talent upon. The germ of the work seemed only capable
      of tragic treatment, if the book were to be artistic. Their hero was a man
      of strong intellect, of physical beauty, full at first of the joy of life,
      chivalrous, a believer in the innate goodness of human nature. Believing
      in goodness, he believed also ardently in influence. In fact, he was a
      worshipper of influence, and his main passion was to seize upon the
      personalities of others, and impose his own personality upon them. He
      loved to make men and women see with his eyes and hear with his ears,
      adopt his theories as truth, take his judgment for their own. All that he
      thought <i>was</i>&mdash;to him. He never doubted himself, therefore he
      could not bear that those around him should not think with him, act
      towards men and women as he acted, face life as he faced it. Yet he was
      too subtle ever to be dogmatic. He never shouted in the market-place. He
      led those with whom he came in contact as adroitly as if he had been evil,
      and to the influence of others he was as adamant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events brought into his life a woman, complex, subtle too, with a
      naturally noble character and fine understanding, a woman who, like so
      many women, might have been anything, and was far worse than nothing&mdash;a
      hopeless, helpless slave, the victim of the morphia habit, which had
      gradually degraded her, driven her through sloughs of immorality, wrecked
      a professional career which at one time had been almost great, shattered
      her constitution, though not all her still curious beauty, and ruined her,
      to all intents and purposes, body and soul. The man and the woman met, and
      in a flash the man saw what she had been, what she might have been, what,
      perhaps, in spite of all, she still was, somewhere, somehow. In her
      horrible degradation, in her dense despair, she fascinated him. He could
      only see the fire bursting out of the swamp. He could only feel on his
      cheek the breath of the spring in the darkness of the charnel-house. He
      knew that she gave to him his great lifework. Her monstrous habit he
      simply could not comprehend. It was altogether as fantastic to him as
      absolute virtue sometimes seems to absolute vice. He looked upon it, and
      felt as little kinship with it as a saint might feel with a vampire. To
      him it was merely a hideous and extraordinary growth, which had fastened
      like a cancer upon a beautiful and wonderful body, and which must be cut
      out. He was profoundly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved the woman. Seeing her governed entirely by a vice, he made the
      very common mistake of believing her to have a weak personality, easily
      falling, perhaps for that very reason as easily lifted to her feet. He
      resolved to save her, to devote all his powers, all his subtlety, all his
      intellect, all his strong force of will, to weaning this woman from her
      fatal habit. She was a married woman, long ago left, to kill herself if
      she would, by the husband whose happiness she had wrecked. He took her to
      live with him. For her sake he defied the world, and set himself to do
      angel&rsquo;s work when people believed him at the devil&rsquo;s. He resolved to wrap
      her, to envelop her in his influence, to enclose her in his strong
      personality. Here, at last, was a grand, a noble opportunity for the
      legitimate exercise of his master passion. He was confident of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his faith in himself was misplaced. This woman, whom he thought so
      weak, was yet stronger than he. Although he could not influence her, he
      began to find that she could influence him. At first he struggled with her
      vice, which he could not understand. He thought himself merely horrified
      at it; then he began to lose the horror in wonder at its power. Its
      virility, as it were, fascinated him just a little. A vice so
      overwhelmingly strong seemed to him at length almost glorious, almost
      God-like. There was a sort of humanity about it. Yes, it was like a being
      who lived and who conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman loved him, and he tried to win her from it; but her passion for
      it was greater than her passion for him, greater than had been her
      original passion for purity, for health, for success, for homage, for all
      lovely and happiness-making things. Her passion for it was so great that
      it roused the man&rsquo;s curiosity at last; it made him hold his breath, and
      stand in awe, and desire furtively to try just once for himself what its
      dominion was like, to test its power as one may test the power of an
      electric battery. He dared not do this openly, for fear the fact of his
      doing so might drive the woman still farther on the downward path. So in
      secret he tasted the fascinations of her vice, once&mdash;and again&mdash;and
      yet again. But still he struggled for her while he was ceasing to struggle
      for himself. Still he combated for her the foe who was conquering him.
      Very strange, very terrible was his position in that London house with
      her, isolated from the world. For his friends had dropped him. Even those
      who were not scandalized at his relations with this woman had ceased to
      come near him. They found him blind and deaf to the ordinary interests of
      life. He never went out anywhere, unless occasionally with her to some
      theatre. He never invited anyone to come and see him. At first the woman
      absorbed all his interest, all his powers of love&mdash;and then at last
      the woman and her vice, which was becoming his too. By degrees he sank
      lower and lower, but he never told the woman the truth, and he still urged
      her to give up her horrible habit, which now he loved. And she laughed in
      his face, and asked him if a human creature who had discovered a new life
      would be likely to give it up. &ldquo;A new death,&rdquo; he murmured, and then,
      looking in a mirror near to him, saw his lips curved in the thin, pale
      smile of the hypocrite.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      So far the two young men had written. They worked hard, but their industry
      was occasionally interrupted by the unaccountable laziness of Andrew, who,
      after toiling with unremitting fury for some days, and scarcely getting up
      from his desk, would disappear, and perhaps not return for several nights.
      Henley remonstrated with him, but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you do, my dear fellow?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What becomes of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go away to think out what is coming. The environment I seek helps me,&rdquo;
       answered Andrew, with a curious, gleaming smile. &ldquo;I return full of fresh
      copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was true enough. He generally mysteriously departed when the book was
      beginning to flag, and on his reappearance he always set to work with new
      vigour and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Henley said, &ldquo;that it will be your book after all, not
      mine. It is your plot, and when I think things over I find that every
      detail is yours. You insisted on the house where the man and the woman hid
      themselves being on the Chelsea Embankment. You invented the woman, her
      character, her appearance. You named her Olive Beauchamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olive Beauchamp,&rdquo; Andrew repeated, with a strange lingering over the two
      words, which he pronounced in a very curious voice that trembled, as if
      with some keen emotion, love or hate. &ldquo;Yes; I named her as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, as the man in the play remarks, &lsquo;Where do I come in?&rsquo;&rdquo; Henley
      asked, half laughing, half vexed. &ldquo;Upon my word, I shall have some
      compunction in putting my name below yours on the title-page when the book
      is published, if it ever is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew&rsquo;s lips twitched once or twice uneasily. Then he said, &ldquo;You need not
      have any such compunction. The greatest chapter will probably be written
      by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which chapter do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which winds the story up&mdash;that which brings the whole thing to
      its legitimate conclusion. You must write the <i>dénouement</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if I could. And then we have not even now decided what it is to
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need not bother about that yet. It will come. Fate will decide it for
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Andrew? How curiously you talk about the book sometimes&mdash;so
      precisely as if it were true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trenchard smiled again, struck a match, and lit his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems true to me&mdash;when I am writing it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have
      been writing it these last two days and nights when I have been away, and
      now I can go forward, if you agree to the new development which I
      suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was night. He had been absent for some days, and had just returned.
      Henley, meanwhile, had been raging because the book had come to a complete
      standstill. He himself could do nothing at it, since they had reached a
      dead-lock, and had not talked over any new scenes, or mutually decided
      upon the turn events were now to take. He felt rather cross and sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> can go forward,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;yes, after your holiday. You might
      at least tell me when you are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never know myself,&rdquo; Andrew said rather sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking very white and worn, and his eyes were heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have thought some fresh material out. My idea is this: The man now
      becomes such a complete slave to the morphia habit that concealment of the
      fact is scarcely possible. And, indeed, he ceases to desire to conceal it
      from the woman. The next scene will be an immensely powerful one&mdash;that
      in which he tells her the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not think it would be more natural if she found it out against his
      will? It seems to me that what he had concealed so long he would try to
      hide for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Andrew said emphatically; &ldquo;that would not be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; the other interrupted, with some obvious irritability; &ldquo;let
      me tell you what I have conceived, and raise any objections afterwards if
      you wish to raise them. He would tell her the truth himself. He would
      almost glory in doing so. That is the nature of the man. We have depicted
      his pride in his own powers, his temptation, his struggle&mdash;his fall,
      as it would be called&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it would be called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&mdash;his fall, then. And now comes the moment when his fall
      is complete. He bends the neck finally beneath his tyrant, and then he
      goes to the woman and he tells her the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But explain matters a little more. Do you mean that he is glad, and tells
      almost with triumph; or that he is appalled, and tells her with horror?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That is where the power of the scene lies. He is appalled. He is like
      a man plunged at last into hell without hope of future redemption. He
      tells her the truth with horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she who triumphs. Look here: it will be like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew leaned forward across the table that stood between their two worn
      armchairs. His thin, feverish-looking hands, with the fingers strongly
      twisted together, rested upon it. His dark eyes glittered with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be like this. It is evening&mdash;a dark, dull evening, like the
      day before yesterday, closing in early, throttling the afternoon
      prematurely, as it were. A drizzling rain falls softly, drenching
      everything&mdash;the sodden leaves of the trees on the Embankment, the
      road, which is heavy with clinging yellow mud, the stone coping of the
      wall that skirts the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the river heaves along. Its gray, dirty waves are beaten up by a
      light, chilly wind, and chase the black barges with a puny, fretful,
      sinister fury, falling back from their dark, wet sides with a hiss of
      baffled hatred. Yes, it is dreary weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Henley, as I know, the strange, subtle influence of certain
      kinds of weather? There are days on which I could do great deeds merely
      because of the way the sun is shining. There are days, there are evenings,
      when I could commit crimes merely because of the way the wind is
      whispering, the river is sighing, the dingy night is clustering around me.
      There can be an angel in the weather, or there can be a devil. On this
      evening I am describing there is a devil in the night!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lights twinkle through the drizzling rain, and they are blurred, as
      bright eyes are blurred, and made dull and ugly, by tears. Two or three
      cabs roll slowly by the houses on the Embankment.. A few people hurry past
      along the slippery, shining pavement. But as the night closes in there is
      little life outside those tall, gaunt houses that are so near the river!
      And in one of those houses the man comes down to the woman to tell her the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a devil in the weather that night, as I said, and that devil
      whispers to the man, and tells him that it is now his struggle must end
      finally, and the new era of unresisted yielding to the vice begin. In the
      sinister darkness, in the diminutive, drenching mist of rain, he speaks,
      and the man listens, and bows his head and answers &lsquo;yes!&rsquo; It is over. He
      has fallen finally. He is resolved, with a strange, dull obstinacy that
      gives him a strange, dull pleasure&mdash;do you see?&mdash;to go down to
      the room below, and tell the woman that she has conquered him&mdash;that
      his power of will is a reed which can be crushed&mdash;that henceforth
      there shall be two victims instead of one. He goes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew paused a moment. His lips were twitching again. He looked terribly
      excited. Henley listened in silence. He had lost all wish to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He goes down into the room below where the woman is, with her dark hair,
      and her dead-white face, and her extraordinary eyes&mdash;large, luminous,
      sometimes dull and without expression, sometimes dilated, and with an
      unnatural life staring out of them. She is on the sofa near the fire. He
      sits down beside her. His head falls into his hands, and at first he is
      silent. He is thinking how he will tell her. She puts her soft, dry hand
      on his, and she says: &lsquo;I am very tired to-night. Do not begin your evening
      sermon. Let me have it to-morrow. How you must love me to be so
      persistent! and how you must love me to be so stupid as to think that your
      power of will can break the power of such a habit as mine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he draws his hand away from hers, and he lifts his head from his
      hands, and he tells her the truth. She leans back against a cushion
      staring at him in silence, devouring him with her eyes, which have become
      very bright and eager and searching. Presently he stops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;go on. Tell me more. Tell me all you feel. Tell me
      how the habit stole upon you, and came to you again and again, and stayed
      with you. Tell me how you first liked it, and then loved it, and how it
      was something to you, and then much, and then everything. Go on! go on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he catches her excitement. He conceals nothing from her. All the
      hideous, terrible, mental processes he has been through, he details to
      her, at first almost gloating over his own degradation. He even
      exaggerates, as a man exaggerates in telling a story to an eager auditor.
      He is carried away by her strange fury of listening. He lays bare his
      soul; he exposes its wounds; he sears them with red-hot irons for her to
      see. And then at last all is told. He can think of no more details. He has
      even embellished the abominable truth. So he is silent, and he looks at
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does she do?&rdquo; asked Henley, with a catch in his voice as he
      spoke. Undoubtedly in relating a fictitious narrative Andrew had a quite
      abnormal power of making it appear true and real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks at him, and then she bursts out laughing. Her eyes shine with
      triumph. She is glad; she is joyous with the joy of a lost soul when it
      sees that other souls are irrevocably lost too; she laughs, and she says
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew&rsquo;s eyes suddenly dilated. He leaned forward and laid his hand on
      Henley&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the man! that is my great idea. As she laughs his heart is changed.
      His love for her suddenly dies. Its place is taken by hatred. He realizes
      then, for the first time, while he hears her laugh, what she has done to
      him. He knows that she has ruined him, and that she is proud of it&mdash;that
      she is rejoicing in having won him to destruction. He sees that his
      perdition is merely a feather in her cap. He hates her. Oh, how he hates
      her!&mdash;hates her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Andrew&rsquo;s face became terrible as he spoke&mdash;cruel,
      malignant, almost fiendish. Henley turned cold, and shook off his hand
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is horrible!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I object to that. The book will be one of
      unrelieved gloom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book!&rdquo; said Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You behave really as if the story were true, as if everything in it
      were ordained&mdash;inevitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems so to me; it is so. What must be, must be. If you are afraid of
      tragedy, you ought never to have joined me in starting upon such a story.
      Even what has never happened must be made to seem actual to be successful.
      The art of fiction is to imitate truth with absolute fidelity, not to
      travesty it. In such circumstances the man&rsquo;s love would be changed to
      hatred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if the woman&rsquo;s demeanour were such as you have described. But why
      should she be so callous? I do not think that is natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know the woman,&rdquo; began Andrew harshly. Then he stopped
      speaking abruptly, and a violent flush swept over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know her as well as you do, my dear fellow,&rdquo; rejoined Henley, laughing.
      &ldquo;How you manage to live in your dreams! You certainly do create an
      atmosphere for yourself with a vengeance, and for me too. I believe you
      have an abnormal quantity of electricity concealed about you somewhere,
      and sometimes you give me a shock and carry me out of myself. If this is
      collaboration, it is really a farce. From the very first you have had
      things all your own way. You have talked me over to your view upon every
      single occasion; but now I am going to strike. I object to the conduct you
      have devised for Olive. It will alienate all sympathy from her; it is the
      behaviour of a devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the behaviour of a woman,&rdquo; said Andrew, with a cold cynicism that
      seemed to cut like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell? How can you judge of women so surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I study all strange phenomena, women among the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever met an Olive Beauchamp, then, in real life?&rdquo; said Henley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was put more than half in jest; but Trenchard received it
      with a heavy frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us quarrel about the matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can only tell you
      this; and mind, Jack, I mean it. It is my unalterable resolve. Either the
      story must proceed upon the lines that I have indicated, or I cannot go on
      with it at all. It would be impossible for me to write it differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is collaboration, is it?&rdquo; exclaimed the other, trying to force a
      laugh, though even his good-nature could scarcely stand Trenchard&rsquo;s
      trampling demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I cannot be inartistic and untrue to Nature even for the
      sake of a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Well, I have no desire to ruin your work, Andrew; but it is
      really useless for this farce to continue. Do what you like, and let us
      make no further pretence of collaborating. I cannot act as a drag upon
      such a wheel as yours. I will not any longer be a dead-weight upon you.
      Our temperaments evidently unfit us to be fellow-workers; and I feel that
      your strength and power are so undeniable that you may, perhaps, be able
      to carry this weary tragedy through, and by sheer force make it palatable
      to the public. I will protest no more; I will only cease any longer to
      pretend to have a finger in this literary pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew&rsquo;s morose expression passed away like a cloud. He got up and laid
      his hand upon Henley&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me feel what a beast I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help it. I was
      made so. Do forgive me, Jack. I have taken the bit between my teeth, I
      know. But&mdash;this story seems to me no fiction; it is a piece of life,
      as real to me as those stars I see through the window-pane are real to me&mdash;as
      my own emotions are real to me. Jack, this book has seized me. Believe me,
      if it is written as I wish, it will make an impression upon the world that
      will be great. The mind of the world is given to me like a sheet of blank
      paper. I will write upon it with my heart&rsquo;s blood. But&rdquo;&mdash;and here his
      manner became strangely impressive, and his sombre, heavy eyes gazed
      deeply into the eyes of his friend&mdash;&ldquo;remember this! You will finish
      this book. I feel that; I know it. I cannot tell you why. But so it is
      ordained. Let me write as far as I can, Jack, and let me write as I will.
      But do not let us quarrel. The book is ours, not mine. And&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      take away your friendship from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words were said with an outburst of emotion that was almost
      feminine in intensity. Henley felt deeply moved, for, as a rule, Andrew&rsquo;s
      manner was not specially affectionate, or even agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, in the embarrassed English manner
      which often covers so much that might with advantage be occasionally
      revealed. &ldquo;Go on in your own way. I believe you are a genius, and I am
      only trying to clip the wings that may carry you through the skies. Go on
      in your own way, and consult me only when you feel inclined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew took his hand and pressed it in silence.

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was some three weeks after this that one afternoon Trenchard laid down
      his pen at the conclusion of a chapter, and, getting up, thrust his hands
      into his pockets and walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look-out was rather dreary. A gray sky leaned over the great,
      barrack-like church that gives an ecclesiastical flavour to Smith&rsquo;s
      Square. A few dirty sparrows fluttered above the gray pavement&mdash;feverish,
      unresting birds, Trenchard named them silently, as he watched their
      meaningless activity, their jerky, ostentatious deportment, with
      lacklustre, yet excited, eyes. How gray everything looked, tame,
      colourless, indifferent! The light was beginning to fade stealthily out of
      things. The gray church was gradually becoming shadowy. The flying forms
      of the hurrying sparrows disappeared in the weary abysses of the air and
      sky. The sitting-room in Smith&rsquo;s Square was nearly dark now. Henley had
      gone out to a <i>matinée</i> at one of the theatres, so Trenchard was
      alone. He struck a match presently, lit a candle, carried it over to his
      writing-table, and began to examine the littered sheets he had just been
      writing. The book was nearing its end. The tragedy was narrowing to a
      point. Trenchard read the last paragraph which he had written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hardly knew that he lived, except during those many hours when,
      plunged in dreams, he allowed, nay, forced, life to leave him for awhile.
      He had sunk to depths below even those which Olive had reached. And the
      thought that she was ever so little above him haunted him like a spectre
      impelling him to some mysterious deed. When he was not dreaming, he was
      dwelling upon this idea which had taken his soul captive. It seemed to be
      shaping itself towards an act. Thought was the ante-room through which he
      passed to the hall where Fate was sitting, ready to give him audience. He
      traversed this ante-room, which seemed lined with fantastic and terrible
      pictures, at first with lagging footfalls. But at length he laid his hand
      upon the door that divided him from Fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      And when he had read the final words he gathered the loose sheets together
      with his long, thin fingers, and placed them one on the top of the other
      in a neat pile. He put them into a drawer which contained other unfinished
      manuscripts, shut the drawer, locked it, and carried the key to Henley&rsquo;s
      room. There he scribbled some words on a bit of notepaper, wrapped the key
      in it, and inclosed it in an envelope on which he wrote Henley&rsquo;s name.
      Then he put on his overcoat, descended the narrow stairs, and opened the
      front-door. The landlady heard him, and screamed from the basement to know
      if he would be in to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be in at all to-night,&rdquo; he answered, in a hard, dry voice
      that travelled along the dingy passage with a penetrating distinctness.
      The landlady murmured to the slatternly maidservant an ejaculatory
      diatribe on the dissipatedness of young literary gentlemen as the door
      banged. Trenchard disappeared in the gathering darkness, and soon left
      Smith&rsquo;s Square behind him.
    </p>

      It chanced that day that, in the theatre, Henley encountered some ladies
      who carried him home to tea after the performance. They lived in Chelsea,
      and in returning to Smith&rsquo;s Square afterwards Henley took his way along
      the Chelsea Embankment. He always walked near to the dingy river when he
      could. The contrast of its life to the town&rsquo;s life through which it flowed
      had a perpetual fascination for him. In the early evening, too, the river
      presents many Doré effects. It is dim, mysterious, sometimes meretricious,
      with its streaks of light close to the dense shadows that lie under the
      bridges, its wailful, small waves licking the wharves, and bearing up the
      inky barges that look like the ferry-boat of the Styx. Henley loved to
      feel vivaciously despairing, and he hugged himself in the belief that the
      Thames at nightfall tinged his soul with a luxurious melancholy, the
      capacity for which was not far from rendering him a poet. So he took his
      way by the river. As he neared Cheyne Row, he saw in front of him the
      figure of a man leaning over the low stone wall, with his face buried in
      his hands. On hearing his approaching footsteps the man lifted himself up,
      turned round, and preceded him along the pavement with a sort of listless
      stride which seemed to Henley strangely familiar. He hastened his steps,
      and on coming closer recognised that the man was Trenchard; but, just as
      he was about to hail him, Trenchard crossed the road to one of the houses
      opposite, inserted a key in the door, and disappeared within, shutting the
      door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henley paused a moment opposite to the house. It was of a dull red colour,
      and had a few creepers straggling helplessly about it, looking like a torn
      veil that can only partially conceal a dull, heavy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andrew seems at home here,&rdquo; he thought, gazing up at the blind, tall
      windows, which showed no ray of light. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, still gazing at the windows, he recalled the description of the
      house where Olive Beauchamp lived in their book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took it from this,&rdquo; Henley said to himself. Yes, that was obvious.
      Trenchard had described the prison-house of despair, where the two victims
      of a strange, desolating habit shut themselves up to sink, with a curious
      minuteness. He had even devoted a paragraph to the tall iron gate, whose
      round handle he had written of as &ldquo;bald, and exposed to the wind from the
      river, the paint having long since been worn off it.&rdquo; In the twilight
      Henley bent down and examined the handle of the gate. The paint seemed to
      have been scraped from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curiously real that book has become to me!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I could
      almost believe that if I knocked upon that door, and was let in, I should
      find Olive Beauchamp stretched on a couch in the room that lies beyond
      those gaunt, shuttered windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a last glance at the house, and as he did so he fancied that he
      heard a slight cry come from it to him. He listened attentively and heard
      nothing more. Then he walked away toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached his room, he found upon his table the envelope which
      Trenchard had directed to him. He opened it, and unwrapped the key from
      the inclosed sheet of note-paper, on which were written these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dear Jack,

     &ldquo;I am off again. And this time I can&rsquo;t say when I shall be
     back. In any case, I have completed my part of the book, and
     leave the finishing of it in your hands. This is the key of
     the drawer in which I have locked the manuscript. You have
     not seen most of the last volume. Read it, and judge for
     yourself whether the <i>dénouement</i> can be anything but
     utterly tragic. I will not outline to you what I have
     thought of for it. If you have any difficulty about the
     <i>finale</i>, I shall be able to help you with it even if you do
     not see me again for some time. By the way, what nonsense
     that saying is, &lsquo;Dead men tell no tales!&rsquo; Half the best
     tales in the world are told, or at least completed, by dead
     men.

    &ldquo;Yours ever,

     &ldquo;A. T.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Henley laid this note down and turned cold all over. It was the concluding
      sentence which had struck a chill through his heart. He took the key in
      his hand, went down to Trenchard&rsquo;s room, unlocked the drawer in his
      writing-table, and took out the manuscript. What did Andrew mean by that
      sinister sentence? A tale completed by a dead man! Henley sat down by the
      fire with the manuscript in his hands and began to read. He was called
      away to dinner; but immediately afterward he returned to his task, and
      till late into the night his glance travelled down the closely-written
      sheets one after the other, until the light from the candles grew blurred
      and indistinct, and his eyes ached. But still he read on. The power and
      gloom of Andrew&rsquo;s narrative held him in a vice, and then he was searching
      for a clue in the labyrinth of words. At last he came to the final
      paragraph, and then to the final sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at length he laid his hand upon the door that divided him from Fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henley put the sheet down carefully upon the table. It was three o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, and the room seemed full of a strange, breathless cold,
      the peculiar chilliness that precedes the dawn. The fire was burning
      brightly enough, yet the warmth it emitted scarcely seemed to combat the
      frosty air that penetrated from without, and Henley shivered as he rose
      from his seat. His brows were drawn together, and he was thinking deeply.
      A light seemed slowly struggling into his soul. That last sentence of
      Tren-chard&rsquo;s connected itself with what he had seen in the afternoon on
      the Chelsea Embankment. &ldquo;He laid his hand upon the door that divided him
      from Fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange idea dawned in Henley&rsquo;s mind, an idea which made many things
      clear to him. Yet he put it away, and sat down again to read the
      unfinished book once more. Andrew had carried on the story of the man&rsquo;s
      growing hatred of the woman whom he had tried to rescue, until it had
      developed into a deadly fury, threatening immediate action. Then he had
      left the <i>dénouement</i> in Henley&rsquo;s hands. He had left it ostensibly in
      Henley&rsquo;s hands, but the latter, reading the manuscript again with intense
      care, saw that matters had been so contrived that the knot of the novel
      could only be cut by murder. As it had been written, the man must
      inevitably murder the woman. And Andrew? All through the night Henley
      thought of him as he had last seen him, opening the door of the red house
      with the tattered creepers climbing over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when it was dawn, he went up to bed tired out, after leaving a
      written direction to the servant not to call him in the morning. When he
      awoke and looked at his watch it was past two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He
      sprang out of bed, dressed, and after a hasty meal, half breakfast, half
      lunch, set out towards Chelsea. The day was bright and cold. The sun shone
      on the river and sparkled on the windows of the houses on the Embankment.
      Many people were about, and they looked cheerful. The weight of depression
      that had settled upon Henley was lifted. He thought of the strange, yet
      illuminating, idea that had occurred to him in the night, and now, in
      broad daylight, it seemed clothed in absurdity. He laughed at it. Yet he
      quickened his steps toward the red house with the tarnished iron gate and
      the tattered creepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But long before he reached it he met a boy sauntering along the
      thoroughfare and shouting newspapers. He sang out unflinchingly in the gay
      sunshine, &ldquo;Murder! Murder!&rdquo; and between his shouts he whistled a
      music-hall song gaily in snatches. Henley stopped him and bought a paper.
      He opened the paper in the wind, which seemed striving to prevent him, and
      cast his eyes over the middle pages. Then suddenly he dropped it to the
      ground with a white face, and falteringly signed to a cabman. The <i>dénouement</i>
      was written. The previous night, in a house on the Chelsea Embankment, a
      woman had been done to death, and the murderer had crept out and thrown
      himself into the gray, hurrying river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s name was Olive Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END.
